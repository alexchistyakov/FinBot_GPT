    "Alaska Airlines has begun flying Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliners again since they were grounded after a panel blew out of the side of one of the airline's planes. The airline said in a statement that it has completed its final inspection of their group of the aircraft. They said they resumed flying the Max 9 with a flight from Seattle to San Diego on Friday afternoon. On Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration approved the inspection and maintenance process to return the planes to flying. Technicians at Alaska began inspections that night, the airline said. The airline said they expect inspections to be completed by the end of next week, allowing the airline to operate a full flight schedule. Inspections are expected to take up to 12 hours per aircraft. \"Each of our 737-9 MAX will return to service only after the rigorous inspections are completed and each plane is deemed airworthy according to FAA requirements,\" the airline said in a written statement Friday. The first United passenger flight on a Boeing MAX 9 since the panel blew out on the Alaska Airlines flight departed from Newark, New Jersey, to Las Vegas Saturday morning. The flight carried 175 passengers and six crew members. Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal said in a message to Boeing employees Friday that the company’s most immediate goal is to help airlines restore operations \"Our long-term focus is on improving our quality so that we can regain the confidence of our customers, our regulator and the flying public,\" he wrote. \"Frankly, we have disappointed and let them down. We are deeply sorry for the significant disruption and frustration for our customers, some of whom have been publicly and unfairly criticized,\" he added. The Federal Aviation Administration has detailed the process that airlines must follow to inspect — and if necessary, repair — the panels called door plugs, one of which broke loose on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 on Jan. 5. The plugs are used to seal holes left for extra doors on the Max 9 when an unusually high number of seats requires more exits for safety reasons. Alaska Airlines grounded all 65 of its Max 9 jets within hours after one of the two door plugs in the back half of the cabin of flight 1282 blew away while 16,000 feet (about 4,900 meters) above Oregon. The FAA grounded all Max 9s in the U.S. the day after the blowout. No passengers were seriously injured.\"",
    "Reddit (REDDIT) is considering a valuation of at least $5B, according to a Bloomberg report that cites people familiar with the matter. The company is looking for a valuation of mid-single-digit billions in a debut that could come as soon as March, Bloomberg reported. Much will depend on the new-issues market and the timing of the deal. Reddit was valued at about $10B in a funding round in 2021, and aims to sell about 10% of its shares in the IPO, according to a Reuters report. In March 2022, the social media company had selected banks to help it prepare for an IPO, but was sidelined by the Federal Reserve's rate hikes and risk-off market sentiment that followed. Reddit is a competitor with a variety of websites and platforms for social media attention such as Tumblr, Quora, Instagram and Facebook, owned by Meta Platforms (META), ByteDance (BDNCE) -owned TikTok, and X, formerly known as Twitter. The company intends to make its public filing in late February, introduce its roadshow in early March, and complete the IPO by the end of March, Reuters said.",
    "Expectations that the Fed would begin easing monetary policy as early as March after its fastest tightening cycle in four decades have helped fuel a rally in U.S. stock- and bond-markets. Investors now mostly expect five or six quarter-point rate cuts by December, bringing the fed-funds rate down to around 4-4.25% from the current range of 5.25-5.5%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  See: Economic growth underlined by fourth-quarter GDP reinforces Fed’s cautious approach to rate cuts While no interest-rate change is expected for the central bank’s first policy meeting this year, some market analysts think comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his news conference on Wednesday are likely to shift the market’s expectations and push back against forecasts of a March cut.  Thierry Wizman, global FX and interest rates strategist at Macquarie, said a stock-market rally, \"too-dovish\" signals from the Fed’s December meeting, a still-resilient labor market and escalating Middle East conflicts may indicate that Powell has to keep the \"[monetary] tightening bias\" next week.  The rally in the stock market could \"conceivably backfire\" by virtue of a loosening of financial conditions, while the labor market has not weakened to the extent that the Fed officials would have hoped, Wizman told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Friday. Further complicating things, fears that inflation could spike again in light of the conflict in the Middle East and Red Sea could reinforce Fed’s cautious approach to rate cuts, he said.  Meanwhile, a shift to \"neutral bias\" doesn’t automatically mean that the Fed will cut the policy rate soon since the Fed still needs to go to \"easing bias\" before actually trimming rates, Wizman said. \"I think the market gets too dovish and does not realize the Fed has very, very good reasons to push this [the first rate cut] out to June.\"",
    "Tech behemoths will face their next test to keep the market’s throne this week, after a bleak quarter from Tesla sent its stock sliding. Tesla shares have tumbled more than 26% so far in 2024 after the electric-vehicle maker reported a fourth-quarter operating margin that has almost halved to 8.2% from the year-earlier period. Tesla also warned that it expects slower sales growth this year. That comes as the rest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" — Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet — continue climbing higher. Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Alphabet shares closed at record levels several times last week. Now, they face their own tests. Microsoft and Alphabet report earnings on Tuesday, with Amazon, Meta Platforms and Apple to follow on Thursday. Nvidia reports quarterly results on February 21. Excluding Tesla, the Magnificent Seven is projected to report an aggregate 53.7% fourth-quarter earnings growth from the prior year, according to FactSet. Companies in the S&P 500 index are expected to report a 10.5% earnings decline minus those six firms. The Magnificent Seven’s quarterly results will be some of the most-watched this earnings season, due to the outsized influence the group has had over the broader market since last year. The returns in the Magnificent Seven drove about 62% of the benchmark index’s 26% total return last year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Some investors say that while it’s unclear whether the elite tech cohort will continue its reign as the market’s top brass this year, it will be difficult for the stocks to repeat their blockbuster gains from 2023. \"You’re coming in to a tougher and higher bar this year,\" said Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen. \"That will be the headwind to returns this year for tech.\" Investors crowded into mega-cap tech stocks last year after the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 prompted a flurry of artificial excitement. While the market rally broadened in late 2023 as optimism swirled that the Federal Reserve would soon start cutting rates, Wall Street still didn’t retire its old playbook. So far this year, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials indexes have reached all-time highs and topped their closing records several times over. So has the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. But the Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of US small-cap stocks, is down 2.4% for the year compared to the S&P 500 index’s 2.5% gain. The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, which gives every stock the same influence over its performance, has fallen 0.4%. The \"Magnificent Seven\" excluding Tesla has a combined market cap of roughly $12 trillion, according to Bespoke Investment Group data through Wednesday’s close. That’s equivalent to over 65% of the Russell 2000’s market cap. Shelby McFaddin, investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management, said she will home in on cash flow when parsing quarterly earnings reports from big tech companies this week. Her firm owns all of the Magnificent Seven stocks except for Tesla. \"You can model out top-line growth until you’re blue in the face, but eventually, you run out. It can’t be infinite. So, if you’re doing AI, what does it do?\" said McFaddin. \"That’s what everyone has to answer to, because there’s a lot of aspiration in a lot of these valuations.\" Some investors say that the Magnificent Seven could extend their dominance even if the Federal Reserve doesn’t cut interest rates as expected, thanks to their status as one of Wall Street’s favorite defensive plays. Investors sought out big tech stocks last year during turbulent times like the regional banking crisis, figuring that their flush balance sheets and AI involvement made them dependable havens. The Fed has projected three rate cuts for 2024, and data released so far this year suggests the economy remains resilient against rates currently hovering around a 23-year high. Still, that doesn’t guarantee continued strength in markets. \"My concern is more towards the tail end of the year. Advertisers — is there going to be the demand? Are we heading into a recession? I don’t know,\" said Joe Mazzola, director of trader education at Charles Schwab.",
    "HONG KONG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A Hong Kong court on Monday ordered the liquidation of property giant China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), opens new tab, a move likely to send ripples through China's crumbling financial markets as policymakers scramble to contain a deepening crisis. Justice Linda Chan decided to liquidate the world's most indebted developer, with more than $300 billion of total liabilities, after noting Evergrande had been unable to offer a concrete restructuring plan more than two years after defaulting on a bond repayment and after several court hearings. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" said Chan, who will give her detailed reasoning later on Monday. Evergrande chief executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media the company will ensure home building projects will still be delivered despite the liquidation order. The order would not affect the operations of Evergrande's onshore and offshore units, he added. The decision sets the stage for what is expected to be drawn-out and complicated process with potential political considerations, given the many authorities involved. Offshore investors will be focused on how Chinese authorities treat foreign creditors when a company fails. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" said Chan, who will give her detailed reasoning later on Monday. Evergrande chief executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media the company will ensure home building projects will still be delivered despite the liquidation order. The order would not affect the operations of Evergrande's onshore and offshore units, he added. The decision sets the stage for what is expected to be drawn-out and complicated process with potential political considerations, given the many authorities involved. Offshore investors will be focused on how Chinese authorities treat foreign creditors when a company fails. Evergrande's shares were trading down as much as 20% before the hearing. Trading was halted in China Evergrande and its listed subsidiaries China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group (0708.HK), opens new tab and Evergrande Property Services (6666.HK), opens new tab after the verdict. Evergrande, which has $240 billion of assets, sent a struggling property sector into a tailspin when it defaulted on its debt in 2021 and the liquidation ruling will likely further jolt already fragile Chinese capital and property markets. Beijing is grappling with an underperforming economy, its worst property market in nine years and a stock market wallowing near five-year lows, so any fresh jolt to investor confidence could further undermine policymakers' efforts to rejuvenate growth. Evergrande applied for another adjournment on Monday as its lawyer said it had made \"some progress\" on the restructuring proposal. In the latest offer, the developer proposed creditors swap their debts into all the shares the company holds in its two Hong Kong units, compared to stakes of about 30% in the subsidiaries ahead of the last hearing in December. Evergrande's lawyer argued liquidation could harm the operations of the company, and its property management and electric vehicle units, which would in turn hurt the group's ability to repay all creditors. Evergrande had been working on a $23 billion debt revamp plan with a group of creditors known as the ad hoc bondholder group for almost two years. \"We're not surprised by the outcome and it's a product of the company failing to engage with the ad hoc group,\" said Fergus Saurin, a Kirkland & Ellis partner who had advised the offshore bondholders. \"There has been a history of last minute engagement which has gone nowhere. And in the circumstances, the company only has itself to blame for being wound up.\" Evergrande cited a Deloitte analysis during a Hong Kong court hearing in July that estimated a recovery rate of 3.4% if the developer were liquidated. After Evergrande said in September its flagship unit and its chairman Hui Ka Yan were being investigated by the authorities for unspecified crimes, creditors now expect a recovery rate of less than 3%. The ruling is expected to have little impact on the company's operations including home construction projects in the near term, as it could take months or years for the offshore liquidator appointed by the creditors to take control of subsidiaries across mainland China - a different jurisdiction from Hong Kong. The liquidation petition was first filed in June 2022 by Top Shine, an investor in Evergrande unit Fangchebao which said the developer had failed to honour an agreement to repurchase shares it had bought in the subsidiary. Before Monday, at least three Chinese developers have been ordered by a Hong Kong court to liquidate since the current debt crisis unfolded in mid-2021."

    "Operator\\nGreetings, and welcome to the Microsoft fiscal-year 2024 second quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brett Iversen, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer; Amy Hood, chief financial officer; Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer; and Keith Dolliver, corporate secretary and deputy general counsel. On the Microsoft investor relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft investor relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call.\\nMicrosoft completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard this quarter, and we are reporting its results in our more personal computing segment, beginning on October 13, 2023. Accordingly, our Xbox content and services revenue growth investor metric includes the net impact of Activision. Additionally, our press release and slide deck contain supplemental information regarding the net impact of the Activision acquisition on our financial results. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items.\\n The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates and constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business is performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.\\nWhere growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.\\nYou can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft investor relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nWe do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Brett. It was a record quarter, driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We move from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains.\\nNow, I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress, starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI Advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLMs and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure data and tools on Azure.\\nWe now have 53,000 Azure AI customers. Over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models-as-a-service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs from our partners, like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral, on Azure without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device.\\nAnker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM Phi for their applications, and we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter, we added support for OpenAI's latest models, including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3, as well as fine-tuning. We are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups, like Moveworks, Perplexity, SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today, including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation.\\nFor example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service, along with its own proprietary data and models, to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how its millions of customers shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide.\\nNow on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale, powering workloads for companies in every industry, from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubishi and TomTom.\\nKPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB, including its built-in native vector search capabilities, along with Azure OpenAI service, to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year over year. And for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution. OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT.\\nAnd this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers, like Milman and PwC, go from data to insights to action, all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake, increased 46% quarter over quarter. Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI.\\nGitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year over year, driven by all our platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter over quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs. Accenture alone will rollout GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year and we're going further making Copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code no-code development helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data, and now build custom Copilots.\\nMore than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter over quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom Copilots. It is already being used by over 10,000 organizations, including An Post, Holland America, PG&E. In just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in Business Applications, Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply chain functions.\\nAnd we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales out Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations, including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric, to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. And with our new Copilot for service employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster. It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and VenDesk.\\nWith our industry and cross-industry clouds, we're tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems, including Lifespan, UNC Health, and UPMC, to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our cloud for retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. Now on to future of work.\\nA growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.\\nWhen it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration chat, meetings, and calling on one platform and Teams has also become a new entry point for us. More than two-thirds of our enterprise Teams customers by phone rooms are premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW, all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps, along with advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics.\\nNow on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years, we're providing one-click access.\\nWe also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year over year. And all up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased two times year over year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now onto security.\\nThe recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems we reported a week and a half ago, have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why, last fall, we announced a set of engineering priorities under our secure future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. And it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio, as well as our operational security posture, to help customers adopt a zero-trust security architecture. Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIM Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape.\\nAnd with Copilot for security, we're now helping hundreds of early access customers, including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel, significantly increase their SecOps team's productivity. This quarter, we extended Copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview. All-up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, JB Hunt, and the Mosaic Company. Now on to LinkedIn.\\nLinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member signups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge-sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year over year.\\nOur new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs, and engage with posts. New AI features, including more personalized emails, also continue to increase business ROI on the platform and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter. And more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum, earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to date, both doubling quarter over quarter and both being an edge took share this quarter.\\nWe also introduced Copilot as a stand-alone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King.\\nWith our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love where and when and how they want. Hours streamed increased 44% year over year. Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio.\\nI've never been more excited about our lineup of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox PC and Game Pass, including Indiana Jones, and we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield. In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusted for the prior year's Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth.\\nStrong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings, including AI services, drove better-than-expected growth and large long-term Azure contracts. Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our office commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base.\\nThe strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%.\\nIn our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels. I mean, the gaming console market was a bit smaller. As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses.\\nThe net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth.\\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year over year to 68%.\\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.\\nAt a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year over year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now, to our segment results.\\nRevenue from productivity and business processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year over year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments.\\nSeat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 355 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses.\\nIn our Talent Solutions business bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business, primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year.\\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses.\\nOverall server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier.\\nIn our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\\nOperating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall.\\nGrowth includes 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year over year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance and higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations primarily [Technical difficulty] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remains healthy.\\nDevices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations of stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier.\\nXbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year over year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\\nOperating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.5 billion, lower-than-expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3.\\nCash paid for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69% driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior-year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year over year, reflecting the timing of cash paid for property and equipment.\\nThis quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations, negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S.\\ndollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point. And we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth.\\nIn commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year over year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.\\nNext to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency.\\nWhile it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, driven by Microsoft's 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses.\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results.\\nGrowth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in the enterprise and partner services revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior-year comparable for enterprise support services and more personal computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion, $15.1 billion, or growth between 11% and 14%.\\nWindows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the low-double-digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products.\\nSearch and news advertising, ex TAC, revenue growth should be in the mid-to-high single-digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low-to-mid 50s, driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year over year.\\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expenses of $15.8 billion to $15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expenses should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses.\\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full-year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full-year revenue growth by less than 1 point.\\nWe continue to expect no meaningful impact to full-year COGS or operating expense growth. Second, Activision. For the full-year FY 2024, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income when excluding purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs. At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1, and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2.\\nOur commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year over year, even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\\nIn closing, we are focused on execution, so our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A.
